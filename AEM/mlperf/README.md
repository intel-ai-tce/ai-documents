# Get Started with Intel MLPerf v5.0 Inference Submission with Intel Optimized Docker Images

MLPerf is a benchmark for measuring the performance of machine learning
systems. It provides a set of performance metrics for a variety of machine
learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, machine
translation, and others. The benchmark is representative of real-world
workloads and as a fair and useful way to compare the performance of different
machine learning systems.


In this document, we'll show how to run Intel MLPerf v5.0 submission with Intel
optimized Docker images and the prepared scripts.

## Check System Health Using PerfSpect:
PerfSpect  is a Linux OS utility for assessing the state and health of Intel Xeon computers. It is suggested to use PerfSpect first to check any system configuration issue before running any benchmark.   
Follow [the Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/intel/PerfSpect?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-perfspect) for downloading and installation, and get the system configuration reports by using [perfspect report](https://github.com/intel/PerfSpect?tab=readme-ov-file#report-command)  
### Xeon
The following are several key factors effecting the model performance for Xeon.  
<details>
<summary> CPU </summary>
Couple CPU features impact MLPerf performance via related BIOS knobs, so please double check the CPU features with your BIOS knobs.
Some important CPU features are Hyperthreading, number of NUMA nodes, Prefetchers and Intel Turbo Boost.
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/CPU_setting.png" width="300" height="600"><br>
     
Please also check your CPU tempertures. The CPU temperture should not be higher than 50 degrees C.   
Overheating will drop the CPU frequency and degrade the MLPerf performance.  
</details>
<details>
<summary> Memory </summary>
One important system configuration is balanced DIMM population, which is suggested to set as balanced to get optimized performance. <br> 
Populate as many channels per socket as possible prior to adding additional DIMMs to the channel.   
It might impact the memory bandwidth if two dimm share one channel. <br>   
Please also refer to Chapter 4 in <a href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/733546?explicitVersion=true">Eagle Stream Platform Performance & Power Optimization Guide</a> for more details.  <br> 
     
From the results of svr-info, an example of unbalanced DIMM population is shown as follows,
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Unbalanced_DIMM.png" width="300" height="600"><br>

<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Balanced_DIMM.png"  width="300" height="600"><br> 
You should also see good numbers for memory NUMA bandwidth if you also benchmark memory via svr-info. <br>
Here are some reference numbers from a 2S SPR system.

</details>
<details>
<summary> Power  </summary>
We recommend the intel_pstate Frequency Driver. <br>
For best performance, set the Frequency Governor and Power and Perf Policy to performance. <br>
Here are related recommended power settings from svr-info.

### Run Compliance Tests
>**NOTE:** Please bypass this step for GPT-J model. Compliance tests are not required https://github.com/mlcommons/policies/blob/master/submission_rules.adoc#5132-inference. 

Run this step inside the Docker container. After the benchmark scenarios have been run and results exist in {LOG_DIR}/results, run this step to complete compliance runs. Compliance output will be found in '{LOG_DIR}/compliance'.

```
SCENARIO=Offline MODE=Compliance  bash run_mlperf.sh
SCENARIO=Server  MODE=Compliance  bash run_mlperf.sh
```
After the compliance test, the logs will reside in `/logs/compliance`.

### Validate Submission Checker
>**For submissions only:** There are several files you should modify before running the submission checker. Here are the changes:
> - In the *systems* folder, there are JSON files. Pick the right json file for your platform and change the following fields as needed: *submitter*, *system\_name*, and *hw_notes*.

Run this step inside the Docker container. The following script will perform accuracy log truncation and run the submission checker on the contents of {LOG_DIR}. The source scripts are distributed as MLPerf Inference reference tools. Ensure the submission content has been populated before running. The script output is transient and destroyed after running. The original content of ${LOG_DIR} is not modified.

>**NOTE:** Please change the system to 1-node-2S-GNR_128C if you use Intel速 Xeon速 6980P Processor

## Check System Health Using Intel速 System Health Inspector:
Intel速 System Health Inspector (aka svr-info) is a Linux OS utility for assessing the state and health of Intel Xeon computers. It is suggested to use svr-info first to check any system configuration issue before running any benchmark. Follow [the Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/intel/svr-info#quick-start) for downloading and installation. The following are several key factors effecting the model performance.

## Running Models with Intel Optimized Docker Image

### Set Directories
Set the directories on the host system where model, dataset, and log files will reside. These locations will retain model and data content between Docker sessions.
```
export DATA_DIR=${PWD}/data
export MODEL_DIR=${PWD}/model
export LOG_DIR=${PWD}/logs
```



### Launch the Docker Image
In the Host OS environment, run the following after setting the proper Docker image. If the Docker image is not on the system already, it will be retrieved from the registry.
model={resnet50,gptj,retinanet,bert,3dunet,dlrmv2}
If retrieving the model or dataset, ensure any necessary proxy settings are run inside the container.

```
export DOCKER_IMAGE="intel/intel-optimized-pytorch:mlperf-inference-4.1-<model>"
# Please choose <model> from model={resnet50,gptj,retinanet,bert,3dunet,dlrmv2}

docker run --privileged -it --rm \
        --ipc=host --net=host --cap-add=ALL \
        -e http_proxy=${http_proxy} \
        -e https_proxy=${https_proxy} \
        -v ${DATA_DIR}:/data \
        -v ${MODEL_DIR}:/model \
        -v ${LOG_DIR}:/logs \
        --workdir  /workspace \
        ${DOCKER_IMAGE} /bin/bash
```

### Download the Model [one-time operation]
Run this step inside the Docker container.  This is a one-time operation which will preserve the model on the host system using the volume mapping above.
```
bash download_model.sh
```

### Download the Dataset [one-time operation]
Run this step inside the Docker container.  This is a one-time operation which will preserve the dataset on the host system using the volume mapping above.
```
bash download_dataset.sh
```


### Calibrate the Model [one-time operation]
Run this step inside the Docker container.  This is a one-time operation, and the resulting calibrated model will be stored along with the original model file.
```
bash run_calibration.sh
```

### Run Benchmark
Select the appropriate scenario.  If this is the first time running this workload, the original model file will be calibrated to INT8 (INT4 for GPT-J) and stored alongside the original model file (one-time operation).
```
SCENARIO=Offline ACCURACY=false bash run_mlperf.sh
SCENARIO=Server  ACCURACY=false bash run_mlperf.sh
SCENARIO=Offline ACCURACY=true  bash run_mlperf.sh
SCENARIO=Server  ACCURACY=true  bash run_mlperf.sh
# 3D-UNet workload does not have Server mode
```
You can also choose to run all benchmarks with one script.
```
bash run_all_scenarios.sh
```

### Run Compliance Tests
>**NOTE:** Please bypass this step for GPT-J model. Compliance tests are not required https://github.com/mlcommons/policies/blob/master/submission_rules.adoc#5132-inference. 

Run this step inside the Docker container. After the benchmark scenarios have been run and results exist in {LOG_DIR}/results, run this step to complete compliance runs. Compliance output will be found in '{LOG_DIR}/compliance'.
```
bash run_compliance.sh
```
After the compliance test, the logs will reside in `/logs/compliance`.

>**NOTE:** If users want to use previous benchmark results for compliance test, please put the previous results under `/logs/results/${SYSTEM}/${WORKLOAD}/${SCENARIO}`,e.g., "/logs/results/1-node-2S-EMR-PyTorch/resnet50/" for resnet50), inside the docker container before running `run_compliance.sh`. The workload must match the name of the code folder for that particular model i.e. "3d-unet-99.9", not just "3d-unet".

### Create Submission Content
Run this step inside the Docker container. The following script will compile and structure the MLPerf Inference submission content into {LOG_DIR}, including 'code', 'calibration', 'measurements', and 'systems'. Ensure the system and measurement description files contained in '/workspace/descriptions' are correct and aligned with your institute before preceding. Optionally pass 'CLEAR\_CONTENT=true' to delete any existing 'code', 'calibration', and 'measurements' content before populating.
```
# Ensure the correctness of '/workspace/descriptions/systems'.
# Ensure the correctness of '/workspace/descriptions/measurements'.
bash populate_submission.sh

# [Optional] Alternatively, if you want to remove previously created contents:
# SYSTEMS_FILE=/logs/systems/1-node-2S-EMR-PyTorch.json CLEAR_CONTENT=true bash populate_submission.sh
```

### Validate Submission Checker
>**For submissions only:** There are several files you should modify before running the submission checker. Here are the changes:

- In the *systems* folder, there is a JSON file. Change the following fields as needed: *submitter*, *system\_name*, and *hw_notes*.
- In *default.conf*, modify *SYSTEM\_DEFAULT* as needed and ensure all paths in *DEL\_FILES\_DEFAULT* containers your company name rather than "OEM".
- In *run\_submission\_checker.sh*, change *VENDOR* from "OEM" to your company name.

Run this step inside the Docker container. The following script will perform accuracy log truncation and run the submission checker on the contents of {LOG_DIR}. The source scripts are distributed as MLPerf Inference reference tools. Ensure the submission content has been populated before running. The script output is transient and removed after running. The original content of ${LOG_DIR} is not modified.
```
bash run_submission_checker.sh

## Check System Health Using Intel速 System Health Inspector:
Intel速 System Health Inspector (aka svr-info) is a Linux OS utility for assessing the state and health of Intel Xeon computers. It is suggested to use svr-info first to check any system configuration issue before running any benchmark. Follow [the Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/intel/svr-info#quick-start) for downloading and installation. The following are several key factors effecting the model performance.
<details>
<summary> CPU </summary>
Couple CPU features impact MLPerf performance via related BIOS knobs, so please double check the CPU features with your BIOS knobs.
Some important CPU features are Hyperthreading, number of NUMA nodes, Prefetchers and Intel Turbo Boost.
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/CPU_setting.png" width="300" height="600"><br>
     
Please also check your CPU tempartures. The CPU temparture should not be higher than 50 degrees C.   
Overheating will drop the CPU frequency and degrade the MLPerf performance.  
</details>
<details>
<summary> Memory </summary>
One important system configuration is balanced DIMM population, which is suggested to set as balanced to get optimized performance. <br> 
Populate as many channels per socket as possible prior to adding additional DIMMs to the channel.   
It might impact the memory bandwidth if two dimm share one channel. <br>   
Please also refer to Chapter 4 in <a href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/733546?explicitVersion=true">Eagle Stream Platform Performance & Power Optimization Guide</a> for more details.  <br> 
     
From the results of svr-info, an example of unbalanced DIMM population is shown as follows,
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Unbalanced_DIMM.png" width="300" height="600"><br>

<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Balanced_DIMM.png"  width="300" height="600"><br> 
You should also see good numbers for memory NUMA bandwidth if you also benchmark memory via svr-info. <br>
Here are some reference numbers from a 2S SPR system.

</details>
<details>
<summary> Power  </summary>
We recommend the intel_pstate Frequency Driver. <br>
For best performance, set the Frequency Governor and Power and Perf Policy to performance. <br>
Here are related recommended power settings from svr-info.

## Prerequisite

###  Get Intel MLPerf 4.0 Inferece package from MLCOMMONS
Users could get the Intel MLPerf 4.0 Inferece package from https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v4.0 hosted by MLCOMMONS.  
Please follow below command to get the whole MLPerf 4.0 Inference package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v4.0.git
```
The Intel MLPerf Inference package is under inference_results_v4.0/closed/Intel folder.  
The model codes are under code folder, and we recommended users to use automation script to run all models.

### Environment Setup for the automation scripts from Intel Inference package
We provides a kit to automate data ingestion, preprocessing, testing, log collection and submission checker. It requires the following software:
* python 3.9/3.10, pip, docker, wget, unzip, rclone, miniconda3/anaconda3

Note that the following approaches are supported for installing dependencies:
1. Install directly
2. Install in a conda environment
3. Install in a python virtual environment

For the option #2 and #3, you need to create the environment and activate it first before installation.

Install the dependencies by:
```bash
cd inference_results_v4.0/closed/Intel/code/automation
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If your servers are working behind network proxy, please ensure docker proxy and the following environment parameters are well configured:
* http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, no_proxy, NO_PROXY, ftp_proxy, FTP_PROXY, socks_proxy, SOCKS_PROXY

## Downloading data and models by using automation scripts
First, go to automation folder to automate the data and model downloading.
```bash
cd inference_results_v4.0/closed/Intel/code/automation
```

Conda is required for downloading datasets and models. Please install Conda before proceeding. Once Conda is installed, you can download the datasets and models using the following commands:
```bash
model={resnet50,retinanet,rnnt,3d-unet,bert,gpt-j,dlrm_2,stable_diffusion,all} output_dir=<DATA_PATH> conda_path=<CONDA_ROOT_PATH> bash download_data.sh 
```
Parameters:
* model: specify a model name, `all` means all models.
* output_dir: the directory to persist data and model.
* conda_path: optional, ${HOME}/miniconda3 by default, root path of your conda, used by 3d-unet, retinanet and gpt-j only.
* dtype: optional, int8 by default, data preicision, currently unused

Download data for all models by using the following command:
```bash
model=all output_dir=<DATA_PATH> conda_path=<CONDA_ROOT_PATH> bash download_data.sh
```

For specific models, e.g. gpt-j, DLRMv2 and Stable Diffusion, Rclone is needed. If you don't have Rclone already installed, you can install it on Linux/MacOS with one simple command:
```bash
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash  
```

For specific worload, e.g. gpt-j int4, use the following command:
```bash
model=gpt-j output_dir=<DATA_PATH> conda_path=<CONDA_ROOT_PATH> dtype=int4 bash download_data.sh  
```


## Running Models by using automation scripts

First, go to automation folder to run models with scripts.
```bash
cd inference_results_v4.0/closed/Intel/code/automation
```

Customize your test by the following parameters:
```bash
DATA_DIR=<output_dir of download_data.sh>
OUTPUT_DIR=<The directory to save logs and results>
SUFFIX=<suffix to avoid duplicate container names>
```
Create output diretory if it does not exist:
```bash
mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}
```
Launch complete benchmark by using the following commands:

To save time, rerun a benchmark directly within a running container without rebuilding the Docker image, creating the container and data preprocessing. For example, to rerun the bert-99 benchmark, use this command:
```bash
python3 run.py -n bert-99 -d ${DATA_DIR}/bert/dataset -m ${DATA_DIR}/bert/model -t ${OUTPUT_DIR} -x ${SUFFIX} -u -r
```

You can run a specific test of a benchmark in a specific mode. E.g. run bert-99 accuracy test at Offline mode by using the following command:
```bash
python3 run.py -n bert-99 -d ${DATA_DIR}/bert/dataset -m ${DATA_DIR}/bert/model -t ${OUTPUT_DIR} -x ${SUFFIX} -o -a
```

## Test outputs
* Runtime log: `mlperf.log` 
* Preprocessing log: `${OUTPUT_DIR}/preproc_<benchmark>_<implementation>_<precision>.log` 
* Results of Performance/Accuracy run: `${OUTPUT_DIR}/<division>/Intel/results/<system_desc_id>/<benchmark>/<scenario>` 
* Results of compliance test: `${OUTPUT_DIR}/<division>/Intel/compliance/<system_desc_id>/<benchmark>/<scenario>/<test_id>` 
* Measurments: `${OUTPUT_DIR}/<division>/Intel/measurements/<system_desc_id>/<benchmark>/<scenario>` 
* Runtime environment: `${OUTPUT_DIR}/env_<benchmark>_<impl>_<dtype>.log`

## Performing Submission Checker
1. Create `${OUTPUT_DIR}/<division>/<orgnization>/systems` directory, and within it, create the `<system_desc_id>.json` and `<system_desc_id>_<implementation_id>_<scenario>.json` files according to [submission rules](https://github.com/mlcommons/policies/blob/master/submission_rules.adoc).
2. Perform submission checker by running:

```bash
cd inference_results_v4.0/closed/Intel/code/automation
export TRUNCATED_OUTPUT_DIR=<a new directory to save truncated logs>
python3 submission_checker.py -i ${OUTPUT_DIR} -o ${TRUNCATED_OUTPUT_DIR}
```
Please make sure you have read permission of `${OUTPUT_DIR}`, and r/w permission for `${TRUNCATED_OUTPUT_DIR}` and `/tmp`

## Trouble Shooting
```
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'status'
```
Solution: start docker serivce before launching the kit.

## Get the latest MLPerf 3.1 release

MLPerf is a benchmark for measuring the performance of machine learning
systems. It provides a set of performance metrics for a variety of machine
learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, machine
translation, and others. The benchmark is representative of real-world
workloads and as a fair and useful way to compare the performance of different
machine learning systems.

## Check System Health Using Intel速 System Health Inspector:
Intel速 System Health Inspector (aka svr-info) is a Linux OS utility for assessing the state and health of Intel Xeon computers. It is suggested to use svr-info first to check any system configuration issue before running any benchmark. Follow [the Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/intel/svr-info#quick-start) for downloading and installation. The following are several key factors effecting the model performance.

<details>
<summary> CPU </summary>
Couple CPU features impact MLPerf performance via related BIOS knobs, so please double check the CPU features with your BIOS knobs.
Some important CPU features are Hyperthreading, number of NUMA nodes, Prefetchers and Intel Turbo Boost.  

![mlperf-bios](/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/CPU_setting.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary> Memory </summary>
One important system configuration is balanced DIMM population, which is suggested to set as balanced to get optimized performance. <br> 
Populate as many channels per socket as possible prior to adding additional DIMMs to the channel.   
It might impact the memory bandwidth if two dimm share one channel. <br>   
Please also refer to Chapter 4 in <a href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/733546?explicitVersion=true">Eagle Stream Platform Performance & Power Optimization Guide</a> for more details.  <br> 
     
From the results of svr-info, an example of unbalanced DIMM population is shown as follows,  

![mlperf-unbala](/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Unbalanced_DIMM.png)



An exmaple of Balanced DIMM population is shown as follows,     

![mlperf-bala](/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Balanced_DIMM.png)


You should also see good numbers for memory NUMA bandwidth if you also benchmark memory via svr-info. <br>
Here are some reference numbers from a 2S SPR system.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Power  </summary>
We recommend the intel_pstate Frequency Driver. <br>
For best performance, set the Frequency Governor and Power and Perf Policy to performance. <br>
Here are related recommended power settings from svr-info.   
     
![mlperf-band](/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/power_setting.png)   

</details>

## Best Known Configurations:

```
sudo bash run_clean.sh
```

## Known Issues

<details>
<summary> "Too many open files" error  </summary>
If users see "Too many open files" error while they build the docker image, the system configuratoin for the max number of open file might be too small.

Users could check the current setting by below command.

```
sysctl -r fs.file-max
```

If users see a small value like 10000, users could set a large value such as 980000 by below command.

```
sysctl -w fs.file-max=980000
```
     
</details>

## Benchmarking using automation scripts

For your convinience, we prepare a set of automation scritps to help you download data, create docker, do data and model preprocessing, run accuracy, performance and compliance test in a batch. Please refer to ./automation/README.md for details about the usage. 
Example on for using automation scripts:
```
# Get the mlperf v3.1 workloads scritps from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v3.1.git

# Go to directory of automation scripts
cd <THIS_REPO>/closed/Intel/code/automation/

# Download dataset
bash download_dataset.sh <model> <location>
# <model> can be resnet50, retinanet, rnnt, 3d-unet-99.9, bert-99, gptj-99, or dlrm2-99.9
# <location> is where you save the data, which can be /data/mlperf_data

# Test model performance
PerformanceOnly="True" bash run.sh <model> <location>

# Test model Auccuracy
# Suppose you have done running the performance test workload, you can skip launching docker container and processing the data
Skip_docker_build="True" Skip_data_proprocess="True" AccuracyOnly="True" bash run.sh <model> <location>
```

For more details, please refer to the instructions in https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v3.1/blob/main/closed/Intel/code/automation/README.md.

If you prefer to understand what the automation scripts do for you, we also provide instructions on how to run model performance/accuracy benchmarking step-by-step in the following sections.

### Get started with DLRM2

<details>
<summary> step-by-step </summary>

If you haven't already done so, build the Intel optimized Docker image for DLRM using:
```
cd <THIS_REPO>/closed/Intel/code/dlrm-99.9/pytorch-cpu-int8/docker
# Please firstly refer to the prerequisite file in the current directory to download the compiler before building the Docker image. 
bash build_dlrm-99.9_container.sh
```

### Prerequisites
Use these commands to prepare the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM)
dataset and model on your host system:

```
cd /data/   # or path to where you want to store the data
mkdir -p /data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/model/bf16
mkdir -p /data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/data_npy

# Prepare DLRM dataset
# Create a directory (such as /data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/data_npy) which contain:
#	    day_23_dense.npy
#     day_23_sparse_multi_hot.npz
#     day_23_labels.npy
#
# Learn how to get the dataset from:
#     https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/recommendation/dlrm_v2/pytorch

# Prepare pre-trained DLRM model
cd /data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/model/bf16
wget https://cloud.mlcommons.org/index.php/s/XzfSeLgW8FYfR3S/download
unzip weights.zip

cd <THIS_REPO>/closed/Intel/code/dlrm-99.9/pytorch-cpu/
export MODEL_DIR=/data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/model/bf16


# dump model from snapshot to torch
bash run_dump_torch_model.sh
```
Note: wget commands use IPv6 by default, if your system uses IPv4, please add -4 option into the wget command to force it to use IPv4.

### Set Up Environment
Follow these steps to set up the docker instance.

#### Start a Container
Use ``docker run`` to start a container with the optimized Docker image we pulled earlier.
Replace ``/path/of/dlrm`` with the ``dlrm`` folder path created earlier (/data/dlrm for example):

```
docker run --name intel_inference_dlrm_int8 --privileged -itd --net=host --ipc=host \
  -v /path/of/dlrm:/data/dlrm_2_dataset mlperf_inference_dlrm2:3.1
```

#### Login to Docker Container
Login into a bashrc shell in the Docker instance.

```
docker exec -it intel_inference_dlrm_int8 bash
```

### Preprocess model and dataset

If you need a proxy to access the internet, replace ``your host proxy`` with
the proxy server for your environment.  If no proxy is needed, you can skip
this step:

```
export http_proxy="your host proxy"
export https_proxy="your host proxy"
```

#### Calibrate and dump int8 model

```
cd /opt/workdir/code/dlrm2-99.9/pytorch-cpu-int8
bash ./run_calibration.sh
```
> Note: run_calibration script does not need to finish, once you see *roc_auc* output you can `ctrl+z` to stop


Export model and dataset directory

```
# export model directory to saved model path
export MODEL_DIR=/data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/model/bf16

# export dataset directory to saved dataset path where .npy .npz are stored.
export DATA_DIR=/data/mlperf_data/dlrm_2/data_npy
```


### Run the Benchmark

```
# offline performance
source setup_env_offline.sh
bash run_main.sh offline int8                   

# offline accuracy
source setup_env_offline.sh
bash run_main.sh offline accuracy int8	          

# server performance
source setup_env_server.sh
bash run_main.sh server int8

# server accuracy
source setup_env_server.sh   
bash run_main.sh server accuracy int8    
```

## Check System Health Using Intel速 System Health Inspector:
Intel速 System Health Inspector (aka svr-info) is a Linux OS utility for assessing the state and health of Intel Xeon computers. It is suggested to use svr-info first to check any system configuration issue before running any benchmark. Follow [the Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/intel/svr-info#quick-start) for downloading and installation. The following are several key factors effecting the model performance.

<details>
<summary> CPU </summary>
Couple CPU features impact MLPerf performance via related BIOS knobs, so please double check the CPU features with your BIOS knobs.
Some important CPU features are Hyperthreading, number of NUMA nodes, Prefetchers and Intel Turbo Boost.
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/CPU_setting.png" width="300" height="600"><br>

Please also check your CPU tempartures. The CPU temparture should not be higher than 50 degrees C.   
Overheating will drop the CPU frequency and degrade the MLPerf performance.  
</details>

<details>
<summary> Memory </summary>
One important system configuration is balanced DIMM population, which is suggested to set as balanced to get optimized performance. <br> 
Populate as many channels per socket as possible prior to adding additional DIMMs to the channel.   
It might impact the memory bandwidth if two dimm share one channel. <br>   
Please also refer to Chapter 4 in <a href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/733546?explicitVersion=true">Eagle Stream Platform Performance & Power Optimization Guide</a> for more details.  <br> 
     
From the results of svr-info, an example of unbalanced DIMM population is shown as follows,
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Unbalanced_DIMM.png" width="300" height="600"><br>

An exmaple of Balanced DIMM population is shown as follows,     
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/Balanced_DIMM.png" width="300" height="600"><br>

You should also see good numbers for memory NUMA bandwidth if you also benchmark memory via svr-info. <br>
Here are some reference numbers from a 2S SPR system.
<br><img src="/content/dam/developer/articles/guide/get-started-mlperf-intel-optimized-docker-images/mem_bandwidth.png" width="200" height="150"><br>     
     
</details>

<details>
<summary> Power  </summary>

## Get Started with 3DUNET
### Build & Run Docker container from Dockerfile
If you haven't already done so, build the Intel optimized Docker image for 3DUNET using:
```
cd inference_results_v3.0/closed/Intel/code/3d-unet-99.9/pytorch-cpu/docker
bash build_3dunet_container.sh
```

### Prerequisites
Use these commands to prepare the 3DUNET dataset and model on your host system:

```
mkdir 3dunet
cd 3dunet
git clone https://github.com/neheller/kits19
cd kits19
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m starter_code.get_imaging
cd ..
```

### Set Up Environment
Follow these steps to set up the docker instance and preprocess the data.

#### Start a Container
Use ``docker run`` to start a container with the optimized Docker image we pulled earlier.
Replace ``/path/of/3dunet`` with the 3dunet folder path created earlier:
```
docker run --name intel_3dunet --privileged -itd -v /path/to/3dunet:/root/mlperf_data/3dunet-kits --net=host --ipc=host mlperf_inference_3dunet:3.0
```

#### Login to Docker Instance
Login into a bashrc shell in the Docker instance.
```
docker exec -it intel_3dunet bash
```

#### Preprocess Data
If you need a proxy to access the internet, replace ``your host proxy`` with
the proxy server for your environment.  If no proxy is needed, you can skip
this step:

```
export http_proxy="your host proxy"
export https_proxy="your host proxy"
```

Preprocess the data and download the model using the provided script:
```
pip install numpy==1.23.5
cd code/3d-unet-99.9/pytorch-cpu/
bash process_data_model.sh 
```

### Run the Benchmark

```
# 3dunet only has offline mode
bash run.sh perf # offline performance
bash run.sh acc  # offline accuracy
```

### Get the Results

* Check log file. Performance results are in ``./output/mlperf_log_summary.txt``.
  Verify that you see ``results is: valid``.

* For offline mode performance, check the field ``Samples per second:``
* Accuracy results are in ``./output/accuracy.txt``.  Check the field ``mean =``.
* The performance result is controled by the value of "target_qps" in user_<number of sockets>_socket.conf file. The scripts will automatically select user_<number of sockets>_socket.conf file according to the number of sockets on customer's platform. Customers can also manully change the value of "target_qps" in corresponding user_<number of sockets>_socket.conf files.

Save these output log files elsewhere when each test is completed as
they will be overwritten by the next test.


##  Get started with BERT
The docker container can be created either by building it using the Dockerfile or pulling the image from Dockerhub (if available).

### Build & Run Docker container from Dockerfile
If you haven't already done so, build and run the Intel optimized Docker image for BERT using:
```
cd inference_results_v3.0/closed/Intel/code/bert-99/pytorch-cpu/docker/

bash build_bert-99_contanier.sh
```

### Prerequisites
Use these commands to prepare the BERT dataset and model on your host system:

```
cd /data/mlperf_data   # or path to where you want to store the data
mkdir bert
cd bert
mkdir dataset
wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v1.1.json -O dataset/dev-v1.1.json
git clone https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased model
cd model
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4792496/files/pytorch_model.bin?download=1 -O pytorch_model.bin
```

### Set Up Environment
Follow these steps to set up the docker instance and preprocess the data.

#### Start a Container
Use ``docker run`` to start a container with the optimized Docker image we pulled or built earlier.
Replace /path/of/bert with the bert folder path created earlier (i.e. /data/mlperf_data/bert):

```
docker run --name bert_3-0 --privileged -itd --net=host --ipc=host \
  -v /path/of/bert:/data/mlperf_data/bert <bert docker image ID>
```

#### Login to Docker Instance
Login into a bashrc shell in the Docker instance.
```
docker exec -it bert_3-0 bash
```

#### Convert Dataset and Model
If you need a proxy to access the internet, replace ``your host proxy`` with
the proxy server for your environment.  If no proxy is needed, you can skip
this step:

```
export http_proxy="your host proxy"
export https_proxy="your host proxy"
```

```
cd code/bert-99/pytorch-cpu
export DATA_PATH=/data/mlperf_data/bert
bash convert.sh
```

### Run the Benchmark

```
bash run.sh                    #offline performance
bash run.sh --accuracy         #offline accuracy
bash run_server.sh             #server performance
bash run_server.sh --accuracy  #server accuracy
```


### Get the Results

Check the performance log file ``./test_log/mlperf_log_summary.txt``:

* Verify you see ``results is: valid``.
* For offline mode performance, check the field ``Samples per second:``
* For server mode performance, check the field ``Scheduled samples per second:``
* The performance results are controled by the value of "target_qps" in user_<number of sockets>_socket.conf file. The scripts will automatically select user_<number of sockets>_socket.conf file according to the number of sockets on customer's platform. Customers can also manully change the value of "target_qps" in corresponding user_<number of sockets>_socket.conf files.

Check the accuracy log file ``./test_log/accuracy.txt``.

* Check the field ``f1``


Save these output log files elsewhere when each test is completed as they will be overwritten by the next test.
